Level Editor where I can create a level and save in on a server

[demo] (http://localhost:3000/editor)


## Synopsis
---------------
(At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview
that explains **what** the project is. This description should match
descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.) )

# Download/Install
---------------------------------------

https://github.com/olpino521/JavaScript-2/tree/PG18Omar/AngryPigs

-Install Node.js
-Run using npm run serve in the terminal
-Open localhost:3000/editor



# *** How to use ***
---------------------------------------
-Drag and drop elements from the right side into the level
-You can move them around as you wish 
-Put a name on the level name input text box
-Save the level
-If you want to load a level, change the dropdown value to the level you desire. If it is already on the one you want, try changing to other then back to that one (this part is not working properly)
-To reset all level values press the new level button

# *** Caveats *** 
---------------------------------------

Saving new assets is missing
Logger is missing. I was going to put a log in the bottom part of the level editor but didn't have time
